#### Utility Package for postgresdb interactions

An ongoing prototype for a tinkering with sqlalchemy, psycopg2 and postgres
*** will probably drop the sqlalchemy requirement soon. Its not really necessary for what I need to do as I usually need a custom, editable SQL query which can be a lot quicker than dealing with sqlalchmey
Mostly this is just for me, personally & professionally. Throwing together, at the very least, some code that I can look back on so Im not constantly googling for SO "uh, how do I connect again?"

Overtime hope to flesh this out into more of a personal utilities repo that I can just pip install and use adhoc
